Run 'pip install -r requirments.txt' in command prompt
Result will more accurate if you are in a proper light area.
To check results just run result.ipynb
Change cv2.VideoCapture(700) to cv2.VideoCapture(0) if you have internal camera
To run EYE-BLINK22.ipynb you have to download MRL dataset from thi link 'http://mrl.cs.vsb.cz/eyedataset'


# Here i have trained my model on MRL dataset with 84323 images.I have used a simple convoluion neural network with 4 convolutional layers and final softmax layer.

# This is our final result on real time data
